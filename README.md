# Solar System Simulation 🌌

This is a simple Computer Graphics project developed in C++ using the `graphics.h` library. It visually simulates the solar system, showing the orbits and rotations of the eight planets around the Sun.

## 🧠 Features

- Simulates 8 planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
- Orbits are shown as circular paths.
- Planets move at varying speeds to represent orbital periods.
- Basic zoom in/out functionality using keyboard keys.
- Real-time animation with adjustable scale.

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Turbo C++ or compatible DOS-based compiler.
- `graphics.h` and BGI graphics support.

> This project uses the Turbo C++ 3.0 environment with BGI graphics driver located at:
